# Taxi_Aggregator_Service
Modelled a real time Uber based Taxi system, using graph algorithms and Dijkstra for shortest path evaluation

Get customer requests to go from a vertex source to a vertex destination and you will have to return the closest available taxi.
A taxi is termed as busy or available, depending on whether it is currently servicing a customer request or not. Initially, all the taxis will be marked as available. They wait at different vertices of the graph.
The taxis will always be in motion. Either they are wandering through the graph or they are servicing a customer request.
Just like above problem statement, the taxis are located at different vertices.
